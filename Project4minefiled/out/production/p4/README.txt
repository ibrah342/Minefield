How to compile and run your program:
To run: Put in the number of the game mode that you want to play
put in the x cor
then put in the y cor
Enter 0 to see the full revealed board and debug or any number to skip
Then play the game
Assumptions:
I'm assuming you follow the rules and put in what is asked and not put in the wrong input. I'm assuming you don't enter
a number

Additional features:
add numbers on the top and side to help with the x and y

Any known bugs or defects in the program: I don't know if these are defects, but u cant put in a string instead of an
 integer, it will throw an exception if you are out of bounds like putting 15 in th easy game mode, also the game just
 exits when you reveal all positions.


Outside sources:
    Idea 1: Getting help on the majority of the methods,
     and some errors I was getting while running the game from TA's
